# ScratchDetector

Provide the binary images for scratch detection and the detection results by using LSD and ours algorithm.

Each group of images has three files which can be distinguish by the filename. The filename of image consist in three part:
 - five digital number is the serial number of image;
 - `input`,`lsd` and `ours` means the image is the input image or the output result by applying LSD or the output result by applying ours algorithm;
 - `.png` is the file extension.
 
 For example:
